## Great Software

**Great software is...
more than on thing**

- great software must staisfy the customer. the software must do what the customer wnats it to do
- great software is well-designed, well-coded, and easy to maintain, reuse, and extend

> ***ðŸ’¡Hint***
> if we have a lot of strings attributes in our class may be we face the problem of Sting comparisons so we can use enumerated types `enum` as in our [**GuitarInventory**](GuitarInventory/Program/) program we use `enum` with [Builder](GuitarInventory/Program/myUtil/Builder.java) and [Type](GuitarInventory/Program/myUtil/Type.java) and [Wood](GuitarInventory/Program/myUtil/Wood.java)

**so what is enum?**
- is type (special class) that repesent a group of constants
- enum achieve **type saftey** and **value saftey**

## Objects
**1. Objects should do what their names indicate**
If an object is named Jet, it should probably takeOff()
and land(), but it shouldnâ€™t takeTicket()â€”thatâ€™s the job
of another object, and doesnâ€™t belong in Jet.

**2. Each object should represent a single concept**
You donâ€™t want objects serving double or triple duty.
Avoid a Duck object that represents a real quacking
duck, a yellow plastic duck, and someone dropping
their head down to avoid getting hit by a baseball.

**3. Unused properties are a dead giveaway**
If youâ€™ve got an object that is being used with no-value
or null properties often, youâ€™ve probably got an object
doing more than one job. If you rarely have values for a
certain property, why is that property part of the object?
Would there be a better object to use with just a subset
of those properties? **in this case we use [Encapsulation](https://github.com/m7moudGadallah/Head-First-Object-oriented-Analysis-Design-breif/tree/main/01.Chapter%201.well-designed%20apps%20rock#encapsulation)**

<p>

## Encapsulation
- it's defined as wrapping up of data under a single unit
- Encapsulation is breaking your application into logical
parts that have a clear boundary that allows an object to
hide its data and methods from other objects.

**ðŸ’¡Hint**
- Encapsulation is not only to make your calss attributes hidden and use getter and setters funtion *Nope* it's also a way to ***avoid duplicate code*** as Example for that [GuitarSpec class](GuitarInventory/Program/myUtil/GuitarSpec.java) we make this class to Encasulate all guitar specs that user intersed about it and `reference` it in [Guitar class](GuitarInventory/Program/myUtil/Guitar.java) so now we can use `GuitarSpec` object with serach tool effiectively

***so if we have duplicate code we use Encapsulation***
